         <h2>What are and  Electric Vehicles</h2>
         <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming our approach to transportation by providing a sustainable and cleaner alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. 
	Rather than depending on fossil fuels, EVs run on electricity stored in large batteries, which can be charged through electric grids or renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. 
	This transition to electric power greatly reduces harmful emissions like carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides that contribute to air pollution and climate change. 
	Additionally, EVs generate less noise pollution compared to conventional vehicles, resulting in quieter urban environments. 
	Moreover, they offer long-term environmental benefits, including decreased reliance on non-renewable energy sources and the encouragement of green technologies. 
	As the world shifts toward more sustainable solutions, the increasing adoption of EVs is viewed as a vital strategy for combating climate change and enhancing the sustainability of global transportation systems.</p>
